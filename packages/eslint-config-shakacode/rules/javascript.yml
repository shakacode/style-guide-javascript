  # Airbnb style guideline has arrow-parens to be used if the body has braces, but not parens.
  # We use flow, so we need the parens sometimes for single params with type annotations.
  # However, we can't always use parens, as we don't want them for simple lodash operations with
  # inline arrow functions.
